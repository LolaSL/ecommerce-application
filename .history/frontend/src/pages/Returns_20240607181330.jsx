            Returns and exchange We aim to simplify life so have a hassle-free
            returns policy that lasts 30 days from date of purchase - just send
            us the item unused in its original condition and original packaging.
            If more than 30 days have elapsed since your purchase we're afraid
            we can't offer a return or exchange.
          </p>

            Refunds Once your return is received and inspected, we'll let you
            know by email then your refund will be processed, and a credit will
            automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of
            payment, within a certain amount of days.
